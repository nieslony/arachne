 1. Arachne stores its settings and certificate in a postgresql database.
    Set username etc. here.

    You can download a SQL file that contains everything to create a database
    user and an empty database. A hash of the password you've entered here is
    also included.

    To enable md5 authentication on your postgres server, add the following
    line to */var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf*:
    ```
    host    openvpnadmin     openvpnadmin     127.0.0.1/32    md5
    ```

    You can test the database connectivity by clicking *Test connection*.


 1. To finalize setup click "finish" on the last page. Arachne will create
    the administrator user, your CA, a server certificate, DH paramers and
    all neccasary database tables and initial values.

    This step takes a couple of minutes.

    you've just created.
